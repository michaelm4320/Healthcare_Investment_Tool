# Healthcare Investment Tool
# Overview
The Healthcare Investment Tool is meant to provide data snapshots to Capital Planners and Healthcare Administrators so that they can make decisions regarding internal investment plans that face patient care. We narrowed the scope of this project by focusing on the field of audiology and the SWFL area. Our project focused on creating an attractive, secure, and user-friendly website and dashboard, while beginning some data manipulation. 

# Screenshots
The following images are screenshots of the Healthcare Invest Tool. The software consists of the sign in page, followed by the main dashboard which displays data about the frequency of ear infection and health insurance. There is also a profile page for the user to add their own information.

# Conclusions
The main goal of the project was to create a tool to assist in making decisions regarding internal investment plans in the field of audiology. During this process our team learned about working with new tools pertaining to web development, databases, and AWS. We have strongly developed our skills when it comes to programming, planning, and designing an application, as well as communicating with clients to gather requirements and ensure they are met. Through all of this, we believe we have contributed to the overall goal of the project thanks to our sponsor, and the academic experience gained at FGCU.
